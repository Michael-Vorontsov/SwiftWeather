/**
 Public inteface for common data operation.
 Data can be retrived from network, file on disk, internal services (geolcation for ex.), etc
 
 Data operation consist of 5 stages:
 1. Prepare for Retrieval (for ex: generate file name or create request, setup parameters, headers, etc.)
 2. Retrive data (for ex. read file, or request data from remote host)
 3. Convert binary data to more general type: dictionary, array, decode encripted data etc.
 4. Parse converted general type to application internal model objects, update existed objects, process and store them, if needed.
 
 Each specific operations should override necessary steps.
 
 All operations should be executed in DataRetrievalManager.
 Manager can perfrome additional operation cofiguration if needed (for ex. add authorization headers, etc.)
 Operations can depends on each others. If parent operation not succeed (breaked with error, or cancelled), depandant should be cancelled, if not forced.
 Forced operations should be executed anyway, after completion of dependant operation (either with error, or not)
 
 Stauts reflects current operation status,
 Stage relects current operation stage.
 
 Name is essential part of operation. Assuming that unique operation should have unique names,
 and if operations have equal names it means that operations considered to do similar job.
 So if one operation with some name is already scheduled, then all next same named operations actually would not be performed, but takes results (statuses and errors) from that operation.
 If operation has no name that identify of operations tracking by default hash mechanism.
